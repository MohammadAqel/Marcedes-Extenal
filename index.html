        <p>Mercedes-Benz has unveiled its new C-Class, which hits the market with a range of electrified engines.

            Expected to go on sale at the end of next month, the new C-Class arrives with four-cylinder engines – both petrol and diesel – which incorporate 48-volt mild-hybrid technology for added efficiency. It’s also available in either saloon or estate form.
            
            The petrol range kicks off with the 1.5-litre C180, which brings 168bhp, while the more powerful C200 uses the same engine but produces 201bhp instead. The range is topped by the 2.0-litre-powered C300 which produces 255bhp.</p>
